## üì± About PhoneAway

### Abstract

PhoneAway is a gamified digital detox application designed to combat smartphone addiction and promote mindful technology usage. The app employs a Pomodoro-style timer system combined with virtual tree growth mechanics to incentivize users to take regular breaks from their devices. By transforming focus sessions into a rewarding experience through apple collection and social comparison features, PhoneAway addresses the growing need for digital wellness tools in our hyperconnected society.

### Detailed Description

PhoneAway represents a comprehensive solution to digital overwhelm, targeting the widespread issue of compulsive smartphone checking and constant connectivity. The application transforms the challenge of staying focused into an engaging, game-like experience where users nurture a virtual tree by completing timed focus sessions.

The core mechanic revolves around customizable timer sessions (defaulting to 25-minute Pomodoro intervals) during which users are encouraged to put their phones aside. Successful completion of these sessions rewards users with virtual apples that contribute to their growing digital tree, creating a visual representation of their progress toward healthier digital habits.

The social component allows users to connect with friends, share progress, and maintain accountability through gentle competition and mutual encouragement. This peer support system leverages social psychology principles to reinforce positive behavior change.

### Problem Statement

Modern smartphone usage patterns have created significant challenges:

- **Attention Fragmentation**: Average users check their phones 96 times per day, severely impacting sustained concentration
- **Productivity Loss**: Constant notifications and the urge to check devices interrupt deep work and learning
- **Mental Health Impact**: Excessive screen time correlates with increased anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders
- **Social Disconnect**: Paradoxically, while more connected than ever, many experience loneliness and reduced face-to-face interaction quality
- **Lack of Mindful Usage**: Most users underestimate their actual screen time and lack awareness of their digital consumption patterns

PhoneAway addresses these issues by providing structured, gamified interventions that promote intentional technology use rather than elimination.

## üèõÔ∏è Application Architecture

### Architectural Pattern

PhoneAway implements a **layered architecture** combined with **service-oriented design** patterns, ensuring separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. The architecture follows Flutter best practices with clear data flow and state management.

### Layer Descriptions

#### 1. **Presentation Layer**

- **Responsibility**: UI rendering, user interaction handling, state presentation
- **Components**:
  - `Screens/`: Page-level widgets managing specific app sections
  - `Widgets/`: Reusable UI components for consistent design
  - `Theme/`: Centralized styling and design system
- **State Management**: Local state with `setState()` and `StreamBuilder` for reactive updates

#### 2. **Business Logic Layer**

- **Responsibility**: Core application logic, data processing, business rules
- **Components**:
  - `Services/`: Singleton services managing specific domains (timer, authentication, database)
  - `Models/`: Data structures and business entities
  - `Helpers/`: Utility functions and cross-cutting concerns
- **Patterns**: Service locator pattern for dependency management

#### 3. **Data Access Layer**

- **Responsibility**: External data source interaction, caching, offline support
- **Components**:
  - Firebase SDK integration for authentication and real-time data
  - Local storage via SharedPreferences for user settings and timer state
  - Repository pattern (prepared for future expansion)

### Key Architectural Decisions

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### **Service-Oriented Architecture**

- **TimerService**: Manages timer state, notifications, and persistence with offline support
- **DBService**: Handles all Firebase Realtime Database operations with timeout handling
- **StorageService**: Manages file uploads and avatar handling with error recovery
- **NetworkService**: Centralized network operations with timeout and retry logic
- **ErrorHandler**: Unified error handling and user feedback system
- **SyncManager**: Background synchronization and offline data management
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instances of critical services

#### **State Management Strategy**

- **Local State**: UI-specific state managed within individual widgets
- **Stream-Based Updates**: Real-time data flow using Dart Streams for timer updates
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through callback mechanisms

#### **Data Persistence Strategy**

- **Remote State**: User profiles, friend connections, and progress stored in Firebase
- **Local State**: Timer sessions, user preferences cached locally for offline functionality
- **Hybrid Approach**: Critical data synced to cloud with local fallbacks
- **Offline-First Design**: Timer functionality works completely offline with automatic sync
- **Timeout Handling**: 10-second default timeout with graceful degradation
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms and user-friendly error messages

#### **Scalability Considerations**

- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation allows for independent feature development
- **Service Abstraction**: Business logic isolated from UI enables testing and refactoring
- **Plugin Architecture**: External dependencies (Firebase, notifications) abstracted through services

## üéÆ How it Works

### Starting a Focus Session

1. Open the Timer tab
2. Set your desired time (using the circular slider)
3. Press "Start" to begin the focus session
4. A notification will inform you about the active concentration phase

### Reward System

- **üçé Collect Apples**: Earn an apple for each successfully completed session
- **üçéüíî Rotten Apples**: Get these when you terminate a session prematurely
- **üå≥ Tree Growth**: Your virtual tree grows with each collected apple

### Adding Friends

1. Go to the Friends tab
2. Share your invitation link or use deep links
3. See your friends' progress and motivate each other
